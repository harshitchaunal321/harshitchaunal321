### 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a developer who believes in building *thoughtfully crafted* software—clean, purposeful, and scalable. My journey in tech started not just with "Hello, World!" but with a curiosity to understand how the world behind the screen works.

- 🧩 I architect full-stack web and mobile applications using **React.js**, **React Native**, and **Java (Spring Boot)**.
- 🌐 Backend wizardry with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Strapi**.
- ☁️ Cloud explorer – deploying things on **AWS**, **Vercel**, and **Netlify**.
- 🔒 Interested in **AppSec** & **API security** – exploring **Burp Suite**, **Frida**, and **penetration testing**.
- 🧠 Always learning. Currently diving deep into **Computer Vision**, **FastSAM**, and annotation tools like **CVAT**.

### ⚡ Fun Facts

- I believe code should read like poetry but run like a machine.
- My debugging face has scared away 3 bugs this week—without touching the keyboard.
- I drink my tea the way I write APIs: strong, structured, and with no sugar (unless required by legacy systems).
